Something to make your lives much easier
--------
<p>When you install the Mindwave ThinkGear
Connector into your system it creates a 
port on your localhost that you can connect to. The port is <b>'13854'</b>.
If you access it directly you will crash something, or everything,
especially UNIX. So be careful
and use the resources provided by me, NeuroSky, and the other lovely
opensource developers who made this possible. <3</p>
